Heart Disease Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical data inputs. It uses a trained classification model to help provide quick, data-driven insights for early diagnosis.

Features
Input patient medical details (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)

Predict the risk of heart disease using a trained ML model

Simple and user-friendly web interface (using Streamlit/Flask)

Data visualization and performance metrics

Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (for model training and prediction)

Streamlit or Flask (for the web app)

Jupyter Notebook (for model development)

Dataset
Dataset Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Features include:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG

Max Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise Induced Angina

ST Depression

Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment

Number of Major Vessels Colored

Thalassemia

Target (Presence of heart disease)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-predictor.git
cd heart-disease-predictor
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the web app:

For Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
For Flask:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
How It Works
Data is cleaned and preprocessed.

A classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) is trained.

The model is saved and used in the app for prediction.

Users input patient data, and the app returns a risk prediction.

Screenshots
(Add a few screenshots of the web app or notebook visualizations here.)

Future Improvements
Add authentication for doctors

Improve UI/UX with advanced CSS or frontend frameworks

Add model explainability using SHAP or LIME

Deploy on cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
